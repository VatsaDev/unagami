<Bot> ... <endOfText>
<human> ... <endOfText>
<Bot> ... <endOfText>
<human> ... <endOfText>

```

## Problems / TODOs
   - more data
     - need more data
   
### whats in the data
 - oasst/oasst-1
 - eluthierAI/arithmetic

## Limitations 

I did not make the data dumps/corpuses that make up this data, and can't account for any biases, as the dataset it self is based off the conversations of real people who may or may not have had biases. The model is meant for academic research purposes, and isn't meant for any important or high risk scenarios. Do not follow its advice
